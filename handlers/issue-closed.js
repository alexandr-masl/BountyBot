/**
 * @function manageIssueClosed
 * @description Handles the closure of a GitHub issue and checks if it has an associated active bounty.
 * If the issue is linked to an active bounty, it posts a comment with instructions for the donor to recover funds.
 * @async
 * 
 * @param {object} context - The Probot context object containing event and GitHub API details.
 * @returns {Promise<void|object>} Resolves with `void` if successful or an error object if an exception occurs.
 * 
 * Behavior:
 * - Retrieves the URL of the closed issue from the event payload.
 * - Checks if the issue URL is associated with a bounty by querying the database.
 * - If the issue is linked to a bounty:
 *   - Fetches bounty details from the blockchain using `getBountyById`.
 *   - Checks if the bounty is in an active strategy state.
 *   - Posts a comment with instructions for donors to recover their funds using the `rejectStrategy` function.
 * 
 * Example Usage:
 * ```javascript
 * await manageIssueClosed(context);
 * // Posts a comment if the closed issue is linked to an active bounty.
 * ```
 * 
 * Error Handling:
 * - Logs errors to the console with the prefix `Error: manageIssueClosed`.
 * - Returns an error object if an exception is caught.
 * 
 * API Calls:
 * - `context.octokit.issues.createComment`: Posts a comment on the closed issue.
