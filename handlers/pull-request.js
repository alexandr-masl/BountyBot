/**
 * @function managePullRequest
 * @description Handles events for merged pull requests. If the pull request resolves a GitHub issue with an associated active bounty, it submits milestones and distributes funds to the bounty hunter.
 * @async
 * 
 * @param {object} context - The Probot context object containing event and GitHub API details.
 * @returns {Promise<void|object>} Resolves with `void` if successful or an error object if an exception occurs.
 * 
 * Behavior:
 * - Checks if the pull request has been merged.
 * - Extracts an issue URL from the pull request body using a regular expression.
 * - Retrieves the bounty ID associated with the extracted issue URL from the database.
 * - Fetches bounty details using the bounty ID.
 * - If the bounty has an active strategy state and a hunter is assigned:
 *   - Submits the milestone and distributes funds using `submitMilestones`.
 *   - Appends a success message to the issue comment.
 * - Posts a comment on the linked issue, summarizing the result.
 * 
 * Example Usage:
 * ```javascript
 * await managePullRequest(context);
 * // This will process a merged PR and handle any associated bounty milestones.
 * ```
 * 
 * Error Handling:
 * - Logs errors to the console with the prefix `Error: managePullRequest`.
 * - Returns an error object if an exception is caught.
 * 
 * API Calls:
 * - `context.octokit.issues.createComment`: Posts a comment on the linked GitHub issue.
